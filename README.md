Infection

A Bukkit plugin

Todo:

- [X] Add auto-loading feature. This means games will load upon enabling of the plugin, configurable in config.yml.
- [ ] Add a "Lobby Mode". This means if a player is in the Lobby, and clicks a join sign, they will see a message that says "You joined <GAME> (2/24 Waiting)!".
This means that there is 2 Players waiting to play, and the max is 24 (The message and max numbers will be configurable).
- [ ] Add a Lobby Wall feature. This is configurable like SG, which means there is a wall of signs, that displays games, and game status. Made with a WorldEdit selection.
- [ ] Add custom sounds and fireworks. To be applied when plugin is near finish. This feature is configurable. It can make sounds for different attributes of the game.
For example, if a player gets Infected, a red firework could launch on the Death Point to alert all players.
Another example could be if a player gets Infected, the sound heard when a ghast sees a player in the nether will play. (I don't know the actual name for the sound)

ALL EDITS TO THE TODO LIST WILL BE POSTED HERE.
